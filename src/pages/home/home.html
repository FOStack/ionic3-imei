    1. Add cordova Android platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Install Uid and AndroidPermissions for Ionic v3 (Both cordova and Native plugins).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: 'npm install --save @ionic-native/uid@4' and 'npm install --save @ionic-native/android-permissions@4' are the terminal commands to install the Uid and AndroidPermissions native plugins on Ionic version 3 projects
  </p> 
  <p>
    3. Add Uid and AndroidPermissions to the list of imports and provider array in the app.module.ts file.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Import AndroidPermissions within the app.component.ts file and declare it within the constructor.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. In the app.component.ts file, create a method to check/get android permissions and call it within the callback function inside of Platform.ready().then().
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Import Uid within the home.ts (or which ever page or service you plan to use it) file and declare it within the constructor.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. In the home.ts (or page/service of your choice), you can now use this.uid.IMEI.
  </p>
  <p>
    8. Export or run the app on your device.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: 'Ionic serve -c' does not support native testing for either of plugins mentioned 
  </p>
  <p>
    9. Accept permissions and close the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    10. Open the app again. The uid and imei will now be available.
